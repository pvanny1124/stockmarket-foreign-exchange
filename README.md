Most important factors in changing Foreign Exchange rates:

1. Trade surplus or deficit between countries measured by the balance of payments
2. Change of interest rates, such as an increase or decrease of the “prime lending rate”
3. Quantitative easing, in particular a government buying up its own bonds to boost their
   prices.
4. Intervening to support a currency, where the country wants to maintain a certain exchange
   rate with its trading partners

We want to create a simple model in which each of these scenarios triggers buying and selling of
currencies in such a way that the buying pressure raises the relative value of one currency and
depresses the other, and selling pressure has the reverse effect. This is ordinary supply and demand.
